 Dyna is a Starter-Theme, based on Underscores and Gutenberg. It is currently under hard development and will become a developer-friendly Theme Framework. You may use it, fork it and do something cool with it.	# Dyna


 ## Features	Dyna is a WordPress Theme Framework, a Starter Theme and Child Theme and a Theme Builder based on Underscores and Gutenberg. It is under hard development, means it is not yet ready for production but can be used for developing own WordPress Themes.

Note that this is just a starter theme, stunning design things will be added soon.	  - [Installation as Theme Framework](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/2.installation.md#installation-as-theme-framework)

   - [First steps with Dyna](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/2.installation.md#first-steps-with-dyna)
## Installation	  - [Develop with Dyna Theme Framework](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/2.installation.md#develop-with-dyna-theme-framework)


 Installation is a bit tricky until we finish our first release. 	- [Quality Assurance and Testing](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md)

   - [Dyna Quality Standards](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md#dyna-quality-standards)
Of course you need a WordPress installation. Download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna/releases), extract the files and rename the subfolder to from dyna-X.X.X to dyna. Upload this folder into the wp-content/themes folder on your webserver.	  - [Code Quality and Continous Integration](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md#code-quality-and-continous-integration)

   - [Browser testing](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md#browser-testing)
Of course you may also use the latest Master branch, but keep in mind that this ZIP-file includes unnecessary files like .git and test-configurations you do not need in your WordPress. They do not harm either.	  - [HTML5 Validity](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md#html5-validity)

   - [Performance and server load](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md#performance-and-server-load)
The easier way than FTP is to upload a ZIP-file using the Upload Theme function in your WordPress Admin. But keep in mind than Github ZIP-files have a unnecesary nested folder. It is best practise to unzip and re-zip the theme so that dyna.zip contains the files, not another dyna-X.X.X folder. Installation works in either cases, but there may be crazy things going on, if you try to use our [Child Theme](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-child) or update the theme later.	  - [Accessibility](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md#accessibility)

   - [Theme Checks](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md#theme-checks)
We will add ready-made downloads on our website and improve the installation of our theme. Stay tuned.	  - [SEO and Semantics](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/3.quality.md#seo-and-semantics)

Code quality is one of the least considered arguments when choosing a WordPress theme. The design weighs too heavily in the eye of the beholder. But for a theme framework or starter theme, quality is an enormously important argument. Therefore quality control is one of the most important components in the development of Dyna. We do a couple of mostly automated tests to assure quality. Read about the current status of testing in our [issue about quality assurance](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna/issues/24). Our complete set of tests is:

 We verify our theme code fully automatically with [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/dyna-press/dyna-starter-theme) and [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/dyna-press/dyna/).	- [Versioning, Roadmap and Changelog](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/8.versions.md)

   - [Versioning](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/8.versions.md#versioning)
PHP and Javascript are the two potential vulnerabilities that allow attackers to hack a WordPress page. Through continuous integration, we ensure that our code contains no vulnerabilities, is error-free and of high quality. In addition, Scrutinizier shows us our code quality, which educates us to code cleaner.	  - [Roadmap](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/8.versions.md#roadmap)

   - [Craft a release](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/8.versions.md#craft-a-release)
We currently do manual browser checks and test with mobile devices and tablets using [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/). We prepare Selenium-based automated tests. Read about the current status of browser testing in our [issue about quality assurance](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna/issues/24).

   - [Credits](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/9.credits.md#credits)
We check the quality of our entire HTML5 source code as well as the CSS and Javascript with various tools, especially the  [HTML5-Validator](https://html5.validator.nu/) and of course the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). These tests are not currently automated, but are performed before each new release.	  - [Sponsors](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/docs/9.credits.md#sponsors)


 ### Performance and server load	<hr/>

 <p align="center">
[![Dyna Performance](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/gtmetrix/gtmetrix-current.jpg "Dyna Performance")](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/dyna.press/HfwXCyXf)	Copyright 2018 - Dyna Theme Framework - All rights reserved

 The web should be fast. With mobile use at the latest, performance became a decisive value for websites. For search engine optimization SEO, speed has always been a key factor.	

 We test our performance regularly, at least before each new release. We use [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/), which includes Google Page Speed and Yahoo YLOW. As a guaranteed value we achieve an A-grade above 90%. Generally it should be possible to crack the 100% value with the optimization plugin Autoptimize and a caching plugin.	

 Second, we test the server load using our own server tools. This ensures that our themes can also run on low-cost shared hosts.	

 ### Accessibility	

 We use semantic code and follow the [WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) of the [Web Accessibilty Initiative WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/). Conformity with the rules is tested with [several WAI recommended tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/). These tests are not currently automated, but are performed before each new release.	

 ### Theme Check	

 [![Dyna Performance](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna-assets/blob/master/theme-check/theme-check-current.jpg "Dyna Performance")](http://themecheck.org)	

 The compliance to WordPress is a very important task. If you use a starter theme that is not compliant you may spend additional hours fixing these issues before you are able to upload it to the WordPress Theme Directory. We check the compliance with the [WordPress Theme Requirements](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/) using the [Theme Check Plugin](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) and the [Theme Check Platform](http://themecheck.org).	

 ### SEO and Semantics	

 Last but not least we do manual checks for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and test semantic code features with a semantic checker, mostly using [Seorch](https://seorch.eu/) and a toolset from Google.	

 ## Versioning	

 We use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). That means a Version is 1.2.3, where 1 is a major release that brings up fundamental changes and includes new features that might also break compatibility with child themes, 2 is a minor release and 3 is a single fix or a set of some bugfixes. We use 1.0.1-test123 for releases only for testing-purpose, 1.0.1-alpha123 for releases that are in an early pre-release stadium and 1.0.1-beta123 for releases that are good for a beta test or development servers.	

 ## License	

 Dyna is a Free Open Source Project. That means it is free of charge, you can use it for building commercial websites and commercial themes. Read the GPL 2.0 Licence here: https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna/blob/master/LICENSE	

 ## Contribution	

 We love every kind of contribution. There are many things you may do to help, even if you are no developer or a beginner. Look for the [want-help issues](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna/labels/want-help) in this repo. We will write soon more about contribution, but if you want to help building just drop me a line or create an [issue](https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna/issues).	

 ## Donation	

 Dyna is completely free to use, even if you create commercial websites or commercial themes. But we would be very thankful to recieve a small donation that helps us to improve Dyna and to empower more people to use our free Theming Framework. Support us to write docs and produce videos. Every cent counts. Thank you!
